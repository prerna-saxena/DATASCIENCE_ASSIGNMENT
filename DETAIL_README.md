I'll now perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset, including data cleaning, summary statistics, and visualizations. Then, I'll extract five key business insights. Let me process the data first.

Initial Observations:
1. Customers.csv: Contains 200 records, all with non-null values. SignupDate is currently a string and should be converted to datetime.
2. Products.csv: Contains 100 products across various categories, all with non-null values.
3. Transactions.csv: Contains 1000 transactions, all with valid entries. TransactionDate should be converted to datetime.

 EDA, including summary statistics, missing values check, and data visualization. ​
Key Findings from EDA:
No Missing Data: All datasets are complete, with no missing values in any column.
Regional Distribution: Customers are distributed across multiple regions, with some regions having significantly higher customer counts.
Product Categories: The dataset contains a diverse set of products across multiple categories, with some categories more represented than others.
Transaction Summary:
The average transaction total is $690, with the highest at $1991.
The most common quantity per transaction is 3 or 4 units.
The price range of products varies widely, from $16 to $497.
I'll now derive five business insights. ​​

Five Business Insights:
Regional Customer Concentration & Expansion Opportunities:
Some regions have significantly higher customer concentrations, suggesting strong market presence. Regions with fewer customers present opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns and regional expansion strategies.

High-Value Transactions & Pricing Strategy:
The average transaction value is $690, with high variability. Premium-priced products likely contribute to this. Introducing mid-range products or discounts on high-value items can help increase accessibility and boost sales.

Popular Product Categories for Inventory Planning:
Certain product categories dominate the catalog, influencing purchase behavior. Identifying the most popular categories can help optimize inventory management and product recommendations.

Optimal Order Quantities for Sales Maximization:
Most customers buy 3-4 units per transaction, suggesting an opportunity for bundle deals or discounts for these quantities to encourage higher sales volume.

Customer Lifecycle & Signup Trends:
Analyzing SignupDate trends can reveal seasonal peaks in customer acquisition. Aligning promotions with these trends can maximize new customer sign-ups and improve customer retention strategies.
